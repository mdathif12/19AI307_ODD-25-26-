# Ex.No:3(b) POLYMORPHISM

## QUESTION:
```
Create a base class BankAccount with methods deposit() and withdraw().
Create two subclasses:
SavingsAccount: allows withdrawal but limits it to ₹10,000 per transaction.
CheckingAccount: allows withdrawal with a ₹10 fee per transaction.
Input account type, deposit amount, and withdrawal amount from the user.
If checking account has insufficient balance print - "Insufficient balance in CheckingAccount (including ₹10 fee)."
```

## AIM:
To implement inheritance in banking accounts by applying different withdrawal rules for SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount.

## ALGORITHM :
1.	Start the program and read the account type, deposit amount, and withdrawal amount.
2. Create a base class BankAccount with deposit and withdraw methods.
3. Create SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount subclasses with specific withdrawal rules.
4. Create the correct account object based on the user input type.
5. Perform deposit and withdrawal operations according to account rules.
6. Display the final balance or an appropriate message if withdrawal fails.

        } else {
            balance -= (amount + FEE);
            System.out.println("Withdrawn from CheckingAccount: ₹" + amount + " (₹10 fee applied)");
